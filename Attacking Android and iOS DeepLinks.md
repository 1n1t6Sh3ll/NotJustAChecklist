One of the most frequently acknowledged vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs for Android and iOS apps is related to DeepLink, which can be exploited remotely. However, it should be noted that attacking a deeplink schemas is not a straightforward work. There are some technical terms which we need to be explored inorder to attack the deeplink successfully.

**What is a deeplink?**

A deep link in mobile application is like a special link that takes you directly to a specific part of a mobile app instead of a website. This means you can easily switch between apps or go from a website to an app without having to click a lot of buttons. It makes it quicker and easier to find what you're looking for in the app. 

## Android
**Android usually have two type of deeplinks:**
- Explicit DeepLinks
  - The technique of using explicit deep links involves displaying dynamic content to users through deep link URLs. By using explicit deep links, the user can be directed to different destinations based on their actions. For example, the user may be directed to destination A via an explicit deep link on their first visit, and to destination B on their second visit, based on their interaction with the application.

- Implicit DeepLinks
  - Implicit deep linking is a technique that enables users to access a specific location within a mobile application. This location is predetermined and remains fixed, meaning that the content displayed within the application will remain the same every time the user accesses it via the implicit deep link. For example, if a user watches a YouTube video on their Chrome browser and then opens it in the YouTube application using an implicit deep link, the content of the video will not change.

**And those DeepLinks can be used using three different ways:**
- Scheme URLs 
- App Links 
- Intent URLs

**App Links**

**Intent URLs**
