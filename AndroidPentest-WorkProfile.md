- We sometimes do not receive an APK file or Play Store link to perform an Android Pentest. It could be necessary for us to install it using a invitation link supplied on the work email.
- To install it from invititation, we first need to sign in with a work email on our device. It creates a separater work profile on the device which means a separater user id on the device.
- The way we use tools like adb, drozer and frida does not works in this profile. 
- Below notes explains how to perform pentest on an app when it is installed on a work profile.
